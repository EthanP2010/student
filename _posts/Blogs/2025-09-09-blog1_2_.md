## What I have done
### Week 1
- On the first day of school, I set up my Github account for the first time and was successful.
- I set up VS Code on my Mac computer, which was a bumpy road as I copied and pasted mulitple lines of code into Terminal. I know now not to do this as it can cause a chain reaction of bad events
### Week 2
- Continued to work on set up and learned tools such as opencs, make, and my repo
- I made an issue to prepare for Checkpoint 1 and showed the changes I made to my about page
- Got more comfortable with my tools and code
### Week 3
- Used themes and Jupyter Notebook and got comfortable
    - Used these tools to get a .90 on the pop "quiz"
- I added more commits to get analytics 
- Split into teams and chose to fix either themes or notebook
- Listened in on the presentation by LXD2
### Week 4
- Split into groups of 6 with mini groups of 3
- Decided on team name, philosophy, tag line
- Copy and pasted from pages to student
- Showed our progress as a group to Mr. Mort and Aadit
- Added comments
### Week 5
- Changed Alien background and Sprite to my own images
